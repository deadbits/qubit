# qubit

Modern social platforms shape how we write and share. But sometimes you just want a quiet corner of the internet to document your thoughts and learnings.

Inspired by the simplicity of "Today I Learned" blogs and the clean aesthetics of platforms like [WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org/) and [Article.app](https://article.app/), Qubit is built for developers and tinkerers who want to focus on writing without the pressure of metrics, algorithms, or engagement statistics.

Write short notes about what you're building. Share useful resources you've discovered. Document your learning journey.

No follower counts, no likes, no retweets â€” just thoughts and code in clean, monospaced type.
